# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8



# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.
# Possible values are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese,
# Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (United States),
# Esperanto, Farsi (Persian), Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian,
# Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English messages),
# Korean, Korean-en (Korean with English messages), Latvian, Lithuanian,
# Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian,
# Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
# Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
# The default value is: English.

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This
# cache is used to resolve symbols given their name and scope. Since this can be
# an expensive process and often the same symbol appears multiple times in the
# code, doxygen keeps a cache of pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small
# doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest
# the optimal cache size from a speed point of view.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9, default value: 0.

LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE      = 0

# The MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES tag determines the maximum number of lines that the
# initial value of a variable or macro / define can have for it to appear in the
# documentation. If the initializer consists of more lines than specified here
# it will be hidden. Use a value of 0 to hide initializers completely. The
# appearance of the value of individual variables and macros / defines can be
# controlled using \showinitializer or \hideinitializer command in the
# documentation regardless of this setting.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 10000, default value: 30.

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see: http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv) for the list of
# possible encodings.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the stylesheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.

# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.

# With HTML_INDEX_NUM_ENTRIES one can control the preferred number of entries
# shown in the various tree structured indices initially; the user can expand
# and collapse entries dynamically later on. Doxygen will expand the tree to
# such a level that at most the specified number of entries are visible (unless
# a fully collapsed tree already exceeds this amount). So setting the number of
# entries 1 will produce a full collapsed tree by default. 0 is a special value
# representing an infinite number of entries and will result in a full expanded
# tree by default.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 9999, default value: 100.

# The ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE tag can be used to set the number of enum values that

# Note that a value of 0 will completely suppress the enum values from appearing
# in the overview section.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 20, default value: 4.

# Use this tag to change the font size of LaTeX formulas included as images in

# The DOT_NUM_THREADS specifies the number of dot invocations doxygen is allowed
# to run in parallel. When set to 0 doxygen will base this on the number of
# processors available in the system. You can set it explicitly to a value
# larger than 0 to get control over the balance between CPU load and processing
# speed.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 32, default value: 0.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_NUM_THREADS        = 0


# When you want a differently looking font in the dot files that doxygen
# generates you can specify the font name using DOT_FONTNAME. You need to make
# sure dot is able to find the font, which can be done by putting it in a
# standard location or by setting the DOTFONTPATH environment variable or by
# setting DOT_FONTPATH to the directory containing the font.
# The default value is: Helvetica.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

# The DOT_FONTSIZE tag can be used to set the size (in points) of the font of

# If the UML_LOOK tag is enabled, the fields and methods are shown inside the
# class node. If there are many fields or methods and many nodes the graph may
# become too big to be useful. The UML_LIMIT_NUM_FIELDS threshold limits the
# number of items for each type to make the size more manageable. Set this to 0
# for no limit. Note that the threshold may be exceeded by 50% before the limit
# is enforced. So when you set the threshold to 10, up to 15 fields may appear,
# but if the number exceeds 15, the total amount of fields shown is limited to
# 10.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 100, default value: 10.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

UML_LIMIT_NUM_FIELDS   = 10


# The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images
# generated by dot.
# Note: If you choose svg you need to set HTML_FILE_EXTENSION to xhtml in order
# to make the SVG files visible in IE 9+ (other browsers do not have this
# requirement).
# Possible values are: png, jpg, gif and svg.
# The default value is: png.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

# The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of nodes
# that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph becomes
# larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is visualized
# by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the number of direct
# children of the root node in a graph is already larger than
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note that
# the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.

# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES    = 50

# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the graphs
# generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable from the
# root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes that lay
# further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this option to 1
# or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large code bases. Also
# note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 1000, default value: 0.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
