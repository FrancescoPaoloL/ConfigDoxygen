# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might

# DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at top
# of each HTML page. A value of NO enables the index and the value YES disables
# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation
# tree, you can set this option to YES if you also set GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

DISABLE_INDEX          = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index

# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom stylesheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting

USE_MATHJAX            = NO


# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for

# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
# The default value is: YES.

SEARCHENGINE           = YES

# When the SERVER_BASED_SEARCH tag is enabled the search engine will be
# implemented using a web server instead of a web client using Javascript. There
# are two flavors of web server based searching depending on the EXTERNAL_SEARCH
# setting. When disabled, doxygen will generate a PHP script for searching and
# an index file used by the script. When EXTERNAL_SEARCH is enabled the indexing
# and searching needs to be provided by external tools. See the section

# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCHENGINE is set to YES.

SERVER_BASED_SEARCH    = NO

# When EXTERNAL_SEARCH tag is enabled doxygen will no longer generate the PHP
# script for searching. Instead the search results are written to an XML file

# external search engine pointed to by the SEARCHENGINE_URL option to obtain the
# search results.
#
# Doxygen ships with an example indexer (doxyindexer) and search engine
